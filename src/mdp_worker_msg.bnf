The following ABNF grammar defines the Majordomo Worker Protocol:

    mdp_worker_msg  = *( READY | WORKER-REQUEST | WORKER-PARTIAL | WORKER-FINAL | HEARTBEAT | DISCONNECT )

    ;  Worker signals the broker that it is ready to receive requests.       

    READY           = signature %d4 version messageid service
    signature       = %xAA %xA4             ; two octets
    version         = string                ; MDP/Worker v0.2
    messageid       = number-1              ; PARTIAL message id
    service         = string                ; Service name
    body            = msg                   ; Key Exchange (optional)

    ;  Broker sends a request from a client.                                 

    WORKER-REQUEST  = signature %d5 version messageid address empty body
    version         = string                ; MDP/Worker v0.2
    messageid       = number-1              ; PARTIAL message id
    address         = frame                 ; Client address (envelope stack)
    empty           = frame                 ; Empty frame
    body            = msg                   ; Request body

    ;  Worker sends a partial reply.

    ;  Worker sends a final reply.

    ;  Worker or broker sends an asynchronous heartbeat.

    ;  Worker or broker sends an asynchronous disconnect.                    

    DISCONNECT      = signature %d9 version messageid
    version         = string                ; MDP/Worker v0.2
    messageid       = number-1              ; DISCONNECT message id

    ; A frame is zero or more octets encoded as a ZeroMQ frame
    frame           = *OCTET

    ; A msg is zero or more distinct frames
    msg             = *frame

    ; Strings are always length + text contents
    string          = number-1 *VCHAR

    ; Numbers are unsigned integers in network byte order
    number-1        = 1OCTET
